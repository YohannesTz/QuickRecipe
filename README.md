# Quick Recipe

This repository contains a Spring Boot application that implements a RESTful API for managing quick recipes. 
The application utilizes JPA (Java Persistence API) for efficient database management and JWT (JSON Web Token)
for secure user authentication. It provides a robust and scalable solution for building modern web applications 
that require user authentication and data management.
